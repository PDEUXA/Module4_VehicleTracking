# The big picture
This repository is part of the ‘projet transverse’ of the [Advanced Master ValDom](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/formation/masteres-specialises/valorisation-des-donnees-massives.html) which is co-accredited by INP-ENSEEIHT and INSA Toulouse.

This year (2019/2020) the goal of the project is to develop a video analysis service. The main functionality is the recognition and tracking of vehicles in order to be able to estimate the emission rate (Co2) produced by traffic in the areas concerned.

# Module4_VehicleTracking
This module makes it possible to make the link between the same vehicles present on different images.

An identifier is generated for each vehicle and will be assigned to it from the first image linked to its appearance until the last image linked to its disappearance.
